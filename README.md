# Data Mining with Orange: Classification, Clustering, and Confusion Matrix Analysis
    
In this project, I leveraged Orange, a data mining and visualization tool, to explore various machine learning techniques through practical application on raw datasets. 
  
## 1. Classification with Decision Trees:

I first explored the classification method using raw data stored in a file. By applying the Decision Tree algorithm, I was able to classify the data into distinct categories. The results were visualized in a tree-like structure, allowing for a clear representation of the classification logic and outcomes.

## 2. Clustering with K-Means:

Next, I applied K-Means Clustering to a different dataset, demonstrating how this algorithm groups similar data points together. The results were displayed using a scatter plot, which provided an intuitive visualization of the clustering outcomes and allowed for deeper analysis of how the data was partitioned.



## 3. Confusion Matrix Analysis:

For the third part of the analysis, I began by displaying the raw data in both table and scatter plot formats to gain an understanding of the dataset's structure. I then applied both the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classification methods. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of these methods, comparing the predicted classifications with the actual data. Finally, I visualized the results again using a scatter plot and a table, allowing for a detailed comparison of the data before and after applying the classification algorithms.



# What I Learned:
Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of the following key concepts:

- Classification: Implementing and interpreting decision trees helped me grasp how hierarchical structures are used to split data based on feature values.

- Clustering: Using K-Means illustrated how unsupervised learning groups data into clusters and how scatter plots can effectively visualize these groupings.
- Evaluation of Models: The use of confusion matrices allowed me to assess model performance, highlighting the importance of comparing predicted results with actual data. This was especially insightful when comparing different algorithms like decision trees and Naive Bayes.
  
This project has improved my skills in utilizing visual tools to interpret data and assess machine learning models, providing a strong foundation for future data analysis tasks.
